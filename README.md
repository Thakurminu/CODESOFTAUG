# CODESOFTAUG
These are task provided by codesoft in the August batch.This is given with the purpose of learning and expreience and growing.The first task is given #task1 is create "TO-DO-LIST".This project aims to create a command line or GUI-based application using python, allowing users to create,update,and track their to-do-list.

The second task is #task2 is to make simple calculator with arithmetic operations.Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice,perform the calulation and display the result.

The third task is #task3 is given passward generator, a useful tool that generate strong and random passward for users.
This project aim to create a passward generator application using python,allowing users to specify the length and complexity of passward.
It includes:
***User input:- Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the passward.
***Generate Passward:- Uses a combination of random characters to generate a passward.
***Display the Passward:- Print the generated passward on the screen.
During all these project i learned so many things like module string and Random which include very simplified functions that help in increasing the time complexity of codes and the code reusability as a programmer.
